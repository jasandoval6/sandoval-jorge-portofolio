## Overview

Rat Brain Atlas is an interactive, web-based visualization tool designed to support research-driven exploration of rat brain anatomy. 
The application enables users to navigate anatomical brain regions through dynamic SVG-based visualizations while integrating relevant scientific literature through PubMed search.

The project emphasized frontend architecture, data visualization, and usability within a research context, delivering an accessible and 
responsive interface suitable for exploratory analysis.

## Key Features

- Developed dynamic, data-driven SVG visualizations using D3.js to represent anatomical brain structures
- Built a responsive React-based frontend using component-driven design principles
- Integrated PubMed article search functionality via the NCBI E-utilities API
- Implemented Firebase-backed image storage to support anatomical reference materials
- Designed with accessibility and usability in mind for research-focused workflows

## What I learned
During development of the Rat Brain Atlas, I learned how to build a web application that integrates dynamic SVG-based visualizations, external APIs, and cloud-hosted assets while maintaining performance, accessibility, and clear data flow between components. Firebase was selected for image storage to decouple large media assets from the frontend codebase and allow scalable access to high-resolution brain images. This decision reduced load times, simplified asset management, and supported future expansion without requiring major architectural changes. 

---

## Rationale
React was chosen as the frontend framework to support component-based architecture and predictable state management as the application grew in complexity. By separating visualization logic, UI components, and data-fetching concerns, the application remained modular and easier to iterate on during development.  

For literature integration, the NCBI E-utilities API was used to connect anatomical exploration directly with relevant PubMed research. This design choice ensured that users could move seamlessly from visual exploration to academic context without leaving the application, reinforcing the tool’s research-oriented purpose.
