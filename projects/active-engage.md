## Overview

El Paso Active Engage is a smart city application concept designed to support older adults through activity engagement, sponsorship, and point-based incentives. 
This project focused on **requirements elicitation, system modeling, and architectural design**, rather than implementation.

The goal was to translate stakeholder needs into a clear, scalable system design suitable for future development.
